# Instructions

The API key has been set as a local variable, in order to do the same on your computer enter this in terminal:

export SECRET_KEY=<put secret key here> and ask Himalee for the key!

API Keys should be installed in config.json

Ignore config.json file (and terminal saying "untracked files")

Refer to Mirela's example (i.e. instructions in README) for further instructions on how to hide API keys and not publish them to GitHub: https://github.com/MirelaI/flask_config_example

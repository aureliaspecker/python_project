# Instructions
API Keys should be installed in config.json

Ignore config.json file (and terminal saying "untracked files")

Refer to Mirela's example (i.e. instructions in README) for further instructions on how to hide API keys and not publish them to GitHub: https://github.com/MirelaI/flask_config_example
